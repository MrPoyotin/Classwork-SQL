My code can be compiled and used by running the command:
python my-dvr.py [text file]
The text file can be either of the two included text files.
It must be written as:
python my-dvr.py ring.txt

This serves as an example. You also need to be in the same directory as the python file.
The text files will also need to be in the same directory as the python file.
It's important to note that if you are to use other text files on my code they need to be structured with the each row
on different lines and the numbers spaced properly.
I've left both the text files I made/used here to serve as examples.

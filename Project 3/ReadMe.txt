For some of the answers the answer will be what is printed after the "_id" field.
The id field usually not containing the answer.
For example: #2 of Part 2 prints { "_id" : ObjectId("62781c6e594fb321d8f61009"), "customer_ID" : "10" }
The answer to the question being 10.

For #3 I was able to print out an array featuring transactions that had totals less than 50. 
Every transaction that doesn't fulfill that requirement is printed as an empty array.
I was unable to actually print out a valid number though.

For #8 I was never able to figure out how to exactly get this one to work. 
What I have written down is my best guess at what could lead to an answer though this guess does not work.
